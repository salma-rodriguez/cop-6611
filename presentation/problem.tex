    \frametitle{Problem Statement}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Client-side caching: better I/O performance with
	    write-back, but not very reliable
	\item Client failure or cache device failure may result in
	    critical data loss
	\item Write-through offers better reliability guarantees
	    but discards performance gains obtained from buffering
	    writes on the client-side
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Proposed Approach}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Increase reliability while reducing shared storage
	    server load
	\item Implement cross-client cooperative caching and
	    replication policies
	\item Replicate the dirty data of a client's cache
	    to the caches of peer clients
    \end{itemize}
