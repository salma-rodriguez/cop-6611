4. Schedule
Phase 1 (September 30 - October 13)
Start the implementation initial prototype:
 Jorge will work on setting up a simple communication mechanism that allows a single client to send block requests to client machine. The goal is to start working with a modified version of the iSCSI framework.
Salma will work on the implementing the logic to replicate a portion of client's block on another machine in dm-cache.
Phase 1 Presentation Slides ( October 10 ): Both Salma and Jorge put together a presentation of their project
Phase 2 (October 13 - December 3)
Expand the functionalities on the initial prototype:
Jorge will add the functionality to the communication protocol to allow a single client to send requests to multiple client machines.
Salma will work on adding the algorithm to trigger the propagation of a client’s dirty data to other client machines
Phase 2 Report ( November 11 ): Both Salma and Jorge work on the putting together a report on their project's status 
Work on finalizing customized iSCSI communication protocol:
Jorge will work finalizing the code of the iSCSI which allows a clients to communicate to be both an initiator and a target for other clients
Finalizing replication policy algorithm:
Salma will work on adding logic to manage replicas belonging to different clients
Testing final version of dm-cache: Both Salma and Jorge
Put together the final version of the cooperative dm-cache
Perform final tests on prototype
 Prepare demo for final presentation
Final presentation (December 3 - December 16)
Present the demo of cooperative dm-cache that replicates a client's data on peer client machines
Write final report: - December 12
