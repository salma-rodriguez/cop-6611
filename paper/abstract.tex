The method of using client-side SSD caches on distributed storage systems has been
limited mostly to write-through configurations. Even though write-back SSD caching
provides better I/O performance by reducing the overhead write requests from a
faster storage device instead of the slower storage device, the potential risks of
data loss coming from client failure or cache device failure can deter users from
adopting these configurations in their systems. This project offers a strategy for
increasing reliability guarantees of write-back caches by implementing cross-client
cooperative caching and replication policies. The results of this research could
potentially allow for a wider adoption of write-back caches in storage systems.
