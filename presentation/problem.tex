    \frametitle{Problem Statement}
    \begin{block}{Facts to Consider}
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Local caching: better I/O performance with
		write-back policy, but no redundancy (not reliable)
	    \item Write-through policy: better reliability guarantees
		but lacks performance gains obtained from buffering
		writes on a local cache
	    \item Client failure or cache device failure may result in
		critical data loss
	\end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Question}
	How can we improve reliability on the cloud while taking
	advantage of the performance gains and energy efficiency
	of write-back policies?

    \frametitle{Proposed Approach}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Want to increase reliability while maintaining a
	    reduced load on the storage server
	\item Implement cross-client cooperative caching and
	    replication policies
	\item Replicate uncommitted data of a client cache
	    to a logical partition of a peer cache
    \end{itemize}
